In this directory are contained several programs.

1)create_int_lines_files - this programm creates two files: line_numbers.csv and line_numbers_golang.csv that contain 2000 lines of random int32 numbers.
2)read_lines_multi - this programm reads file, then directly computes the numbers of factors of all numbers that are contained in the csv file, the 
  second approach in this programm splits this file into several parts to make computations faster, the third approach is using concurrent computations
  with the help of processes. The test have shown that third aprroach is the fastest among three of the abovementioned, takes ~4-5 seconds to execute and
  outperformes the two other approaches almost twice.
3)dask_read_lines - this programm reads csv file into Pandas DataFrame, then converts it to the Dask Dataset splitting it into several parts and then
  applies to the each part factorization and counts the sum of length of each row. This approach does not practically outperform concurrent computations
4)read_files_factor - this programm is written via Golang and is the fastest one among other programms. It takes ~90 ms to execute this programm and count 
  on how many factors are split all numbers in the file.
  
  
Finally, the fastest programm is written in the Golang language.

Here are several files that allow to perform two operations.

First one creates a binary file of size 3 GB using randint function by generating numbers one by one - this file is named create_binary_file.ipynb.

Second one allows to read binary file in numpy array of int32, find the minimum number, the maximun number and the sum of all elements of the array.
Moreover, there are two variants. Firstly, these operations are held sequently. Then, the same operations are held simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor 
for sum and two threads for minimum and maximum.

As a result, there is an increase around 20-25 % when using ThreadpoolExecutor on a laptop with IntelCore I7-6700HQ with 6 cores.
